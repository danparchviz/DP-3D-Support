    "content": "I'm an architecture-trained 3D visualizer with more than 15 years of experience. I studied architecture from 2008 to 2014 and spent a couple of years in practice. From 2018 to 2022 I worked at a leading archviz studio, creating visuals for major firms on projects of all scales and types.\n\nSince 2022 I've been working independently with architects, interior designers, and makers on a mix of projects. That includes buildings, interiors, landscapes, products, and tech concepts. Recent work includes visuals for a cold-plunge manufacturer, a drone assembly presentation, and a high-diving tower proposal.\n\nI love being part of the creative process. I help people explore ideas, shape their designs, and share their vision in a way that sparks excitement.",
